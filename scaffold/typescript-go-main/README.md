## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS 5.9. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS 5.9 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | done | Done, though `tsconfig` errors may not be as helpful. |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS 5.9. |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS 5.9. Types printback in errors may display differently. |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JSDoc | in progress | Mostly complete, but intentionally lacking some features. Declaration emit not complete. |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | in progress | Most common features are in place, but some edge cases and feature flags are still unhandled. |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps. |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking. Not optimized. |
| Build mode / project references | done | - |
| Incremental build | done | - |
| Language service (LSP) | in progress | Most functionality. More features coming soon. |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka "believed done": We're not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven't even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn't bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.9, see CHANGES.md.
